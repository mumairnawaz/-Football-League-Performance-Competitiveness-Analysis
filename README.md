# Background

Modern football has evolved into a data-driven commercial ecosystem. Broadcasting rights, sponsorship deals, player valuation, and fan engagement are increasingly influenced by league competitiveness, scoring behavior, and performance concentration.

Despite the availability of large volumes of football data, many analyses remain:
- Match-centric rather than decision-centric
- Descriptive instead of strategic
- Disconnected from how analytics systems operate in real organizations

In real business environments, decision-makers rarely work with static datasets. Instead, data is retrieved dynamically from external sources, ingested via APIs, and processed through analytics pipelines before insights are delivered.

This project was created to replicate that real-world scenario and answer questions such as:

- Are elite football leagues truly competitive, or dominated by a few teams?

- How does scoring behavior differ across competitions and seasons?

- Is home advantage a structural phenomenon or seasonal noise?

- Which competitions exhibit higher unpredictability and volatility?

 The focus is on business relevance, not fan opinion.

# Data Architecture & Methodology

This project was architected to mirror **production-grade analytics and analytics engineering workflows**, demonstrating end-to-end ownership of data ingestion, transformation, and business modeling.

Rather than relying on pre-curated datasets, all data was **programmatically sourced, standardized, and modeled** to reflect how analytics teams operate in real-world environments.

---

###  Bronze Layer — External API Ingestion (Source of Truth)

The Bronze layer captures raw match data directly from an external football data API, serving as the **immutable source of truth**.

**Key Responsibilities**
- Designed and implemented a Python-based ingestion pipeline
- Parameterized API requests by competition and season
- Persisted raw API responses as timestamped JSON files
- Preserved original payloads without transformation to support reprocessing and auditing

**Why This Matters**
- Enables reproducibility and historical backfills
- Separates data collection from analytics logic
- Reflects how modern data platforms handle external data sources

This layer demonstrates **data acquisition, automation, and traceability**, not manual data collection.

---

###  Silver Layer — Data Cleaning & Standardization

The Silver layer converts raw API responses into a **clean, analytics-ready dataset**.

**Transformations Performed**
- Normalized nested JSON structures into tabular format
- Standardized team names, identifiers, and competition fields
- Enforced consistent season definitions across leagues
- Validated match completeness and schema consistency
- Removed malformed or non-analytical records

**Output**
- A single, standardized match-level dataset (`matches_clean.parquet`)
- One row per match with consistent semantics across competitions

**Why This Matters**
- Eliminates downstream analytical complexity
- Ensures comparability across leagues and seasons
- Creates a reliable foundation for KPI development

This layer reflects **analytics engineering best practices**, not ad-hoc cleaning.

---

###  Gold Layer — Analytical Models & Business KPIs

The Gold layer represents **business-facing analytical models** optimized for SQL analytics and BI tools.

**Analytical Tables**
- `fact_matches`  
  Match-level fact table (grain: one row per match)

- `league_kpis`  
  Aggregated league-level KPIs by competition and season  
  (scoring intensity, total goals, competitiveness indicators)

- `team_performance`  
  Team-level performance metrics  
  (goals scored, conceded, goal difference, dominance)

**Design Principles**
- Clear grain definition
- Business-aligned metrics
- Optimized for downstream consumption (SQL, BI, exports)

**Why This Matters**
- Translates raw data into decision-ready insights
- Enables consistent KPI definitions across analyses
- Supports both ad-hoc analysis and executive reporting

---

### Analytical Access & Consumption

To support fast iteration and exploration:

- Gold-layer data is queried using **DuckDB (SQL-first analytics engine)**
- Business questions are expressed as **reusable SQL queries**
- KPI outputs are exported as CSVs for visualization and reporting
- Gold models are directly consumable by BI tools (e.g. Power BI)

This approach reflects how analytics teams **bridge engineering and business stakeholders**.

# Business Insights

<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><td>

## Scoring Intensity Across Competitions

The UEFA Champions League consistently demonstrates the highest scoring intensity, with average goals per match exceeding both **LaLiga and the Premier League across the 2024 and 2025 seasons**. As shown in the visualization, Champions League matches average above 3.3 goals per match, compared to approximately 2.6–2.9 goals in domestic leagues. This indicates a structurally more open style of play driven by elite team quality, tactical risk-taking, and knockout-stage incentives.

From a business perspective, higher scoring intensity directly enhances:

- Viewer engagement and match entertainment value

- Broadcast attractiveness and advertising premiums

- Global audience retention for marquee fixtures

This reinforces why the Champions League commands premium broadcasting rights relative to domestic competitions.

</p>


---



## Home Advantage Is Structural

Across all competitions and seasons, home teams consistently score more goals than away teams, confirming that home advantage is a persistent structural factor, not a short-term anomaly. The table highlights a clear home-goal **premium ranging from +0.29 to +0.42 goals per match**, with the Champions League exhibiting the strongest home advantage. Even in the Premier League—often considered tactically balanced—the home advantage remains statistically meaningful.

For stakeholders, this insight has direct implications for:

- Match outcome forecasting and betting markets

- Fixture scheduling and competitive fairness

- Team performance evaluation and tactical planning

Home advantage remains an embedded feature of football economics and performance modeling.

  <img src="visuals/Home%20Advantage%20KPI.png" width="92%">
</p>



---



## Competitive Balance by League

Domestic leagues exhibit significantly wider competitiveness gaps than the Champions League, indicating a higher concentration of performance among top teams. As visualized, LaLiga and the Premier League show competitiveness gaps exceeding 100 points in 2024, compared to sub-50 gaps in the Champions League. This suggests that domestic leagues are more frequently dominated by a small group of elite clubs.

From a commercial standpoint, uneven competitive balance can:

- Reduce long-term fan engagement

- Increase predictability of outcomes

- Concentrate commercial value around top clubs

The Champions League’s comparatively tighter gap supports its positioning as a more competitively balanced global product.

## Scoring Volatility in Champions League

The Champions League demonstrates higher year-over-year scoring volatility compared to domestic leagues, reflecting its knockout structure and dynamic team composition.The volatility chart shows noticeable shifts in scoring patterns between 2024 and 2025, unlike the more stable trends observed in LaLiga and the Premier League. This volatility is driven by:

- Knockout match pressure

- Short tournament horizons

- Elite team rotation and tactical adaptation

For broadcasters and analysts, higher volatility increases:

- Match unpredictability

- Viewer suspense

- Demand for advanced forecasting and analytics

This reinforces the Champions League’s identity as a high-risk, high-reward competition.
